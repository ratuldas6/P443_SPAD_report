# P443_SPAD_report

A cheap and simple method for photon counting using an LED as an avalanche photodiode in reverse-biased condition is studied during the course of this experiment. We obtain the counting statistics of photon detection, the effective capacitance of the detector and thereby obtain its decay constant. The dead time of the setup was also computed. The temperature dependence of the counting characteristics of the detector setup was also studied.

Code, data, figures, and the LaTeX source are all compiled in this repository.
